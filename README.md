Initial Project Proposal-

For the team project, the chosen theme that has been decided is data within Olympics. The time interval will be from the Athens Olympics Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. 
The dataset gives the result (Gold, Silver, Bronze) for each sporting event including all participating countries. The questions that we will attempt to answer are.

1) The medal count between the Male athleteâ€™s vs the Women athletes
2) Are women better represented at the Summer or Winter Olympic games
3) Map to show which countries have hosted the Olympics and how female representation has grown over the years 


Initial proposal continued-

Kaggle -> CSV -> Python -> PostgreSQL -> Flask -> HTML,CSS,JS -> D3 -> Plotly -> Leaflet -> WEB
